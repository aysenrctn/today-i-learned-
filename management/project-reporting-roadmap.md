# 📋 Project Documentation: Progress Report & Roadmap

Today, I developed a comprehensive progress report and a future roadmap for the project to be presented to the HSD (Huawei Student Developers) committee.

### 🚀 Key Focus Areas
* **Progress Tracking:** Documented all completed milestones, technical hurdles overcome, and current system status.
* **Roadmap Planning:** Outlined a clear strategic path for upcoming features, including database integration and frontend refinements.
* **Stakeholder Communication:** Structured the report to provide clear visibility into the project's health for the club's leadership and committee members.

### 💡 Insight
Effective reporting bridges the gap between technical development and project goals. A well-defined roadmap not only keeps the team aligned but also ensures accountability and measurable progress.
