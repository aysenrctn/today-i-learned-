# 🤝 Team Collaboration: Frontend Review & UI Roadmap

I participated in a strategic meeting with the project team to review the current frontend and identify areas for improvement.

### 📋 Key Discussion Points
* **UI/UX Refinement:** Evaluated user feedback to simplify navigation and enhance visual consistency across pages.
* **Feature Prioritization:** Discussed potential changes to component structures to improve performance and maintainability.
* **Design Alignment:** Ensured the frontend implementation aligns perfectly with our branding goals for "TalentAI Pro".

### 💡 Insight
Technical excellence must be paired with user-centric design. Regular frontend reviews with the team ensure that we are not just building features, but building the *right* experience for our users.
