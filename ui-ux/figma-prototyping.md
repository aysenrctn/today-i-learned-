# 🎨 UI/UX Design: Prototyping with Figma

Today, I explored **Figma** to bridge the gap between design and frontend implementation. I focused on creating wireframes and interactive prototypes to streamline the development process.

### 🚀 Key Learnings
* **Design-to-Code Workflow:** Learned how to inspect CSS properties (padding, margins, colors) directly from Figma to ensure pixel-perfect implementation in Next.js.
* **Component Thinking:** Practiced creating reusable UI components, mirroring the modular structure of React/Next.js.
* **Prototyping:** Explored basic transitions and interactions to visualize user flow before writing any code.

### 💡 Insight
Using design tools like Figma significantly reduces development time by clarifying requirements and UI structure early in the cycle. It enhances the synergy between visual design and technical execution.
