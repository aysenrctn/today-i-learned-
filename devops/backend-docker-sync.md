# 🐳 Docker & Backend Environment Synchronization

Today, I focused on updating the Docker configuration and ensuring the backend services are running correctly within the containerized environment.

### 🛠️ Key Actions
* **Docker Updates:** Updated the environment configuration to match the latest backend changes, ensuring system stability.
* **Service Orchestration:** Managed backend execution processes to confirm successful "Application Startup" inside the container.
* **Log Analysis:** Monitored container logs to identify and fix startup bottlenecks.

### 💡 Insight
Maintaining a perfect sync between the local backend code and the Docker environment is crucial for consistent deployment and debugging.
