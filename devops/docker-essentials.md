# 🐳 Docker: Essential Commands

Today, I focused on containerization basics which are crucial for cloud infrastructure and scalable systems.

### 🚀 Core Commands
* **`docker build -t app-name .`**: Builds an image from a Dockerfile in the current directory.
* **`docker run -p 8080:80 app-name`**: Runs the image as a container with port mapping.
* **`docker ps`**: Lists all running containers.
* **`docker stop <container_id>`**: Safely stops a specific container.

### 💡 Why It Matters
Containerization ensures that applications (like my Python or Data Science projects) run consistently across different environments, especially when deploying to **Huawei Cloud (CCE)**.
