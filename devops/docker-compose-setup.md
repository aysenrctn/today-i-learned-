# 🐙 Service Orchestration with Docker Compose

Today, I implemented **Docker Compose** to manage the full-stack architecture, allowing the Frontend and Backend to launch as a unified system.

### 🚀 Technical Benefits
* **Simplified Workflow:** Replaced multiple Docker commands with a single `docker-compose up`, automating the startup of the entire stack.
* **Service Dependency:** Managed links between the Next.js frontend and the backend API, ensuring proper communication and startup order.
* **Volume Management:** Configured volumes to ensure data persistence and efficient code syncing during development.

### 💡 Insight
Docker Compose is the glue that holds microservices together. It transforms individual containers into a scalable system, making the development environment identical to production.
