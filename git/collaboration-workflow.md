# 🛠️ Professional Git Workflow & Conflict Resolution

Today, I practiced advanced Git operations essential for team collaboration and code security.

### 🛡️ Best Practices
* **Merge Conflicts:** Learned how to resolve conflicts between the `develop` branch and local code by protecting working logic.
* **Security & .gitignore:** Implemented `.gitignore` to prevent leaking sensitive credentials (.env) and bloated temporary files from the repository.
* **Branch Sync:** Mastered pushing local work to specific team branches (`dev/ayse`) to maintain a clean and organized version history.

### 💡 Insight
Clean Git history and proactive conflict management are the backbones of successful team-based software engineering.
