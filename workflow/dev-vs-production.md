# ⚡ Workflow Optimization: Hot Reloading vs. Containerization

Today, I optimized my development cycle by choosing the right tool for the right stage of the project.

### 🛠️ Strategic Choice
* **Development Mode:** Switched to `npm run dev` (local environment) instead of waiting for full Docker builds during UI/UX design.
* **The Benefit:** Leveraged **Hot Reloading** to see UI changes instantly, significantly speeding up the styling and layout process.
* **Docker Usage:** Maintaining Docker for staging/production-like environments, while keeping the local environment lean for rapid frontend iterations.

### 💡 Insight
Understanding when to use the local environment versus a containerized environment is key to developer productivity. Always prioritize high-speed feedback loops during the design phase.
