# 🏗️ From Prototype to Product: Scalability & Costs

Today, I explored the architectural requirements for transitioning an AI project from a free-tier prototype to a production-ready commercial application.

### 🚀 Key Technical Considerations
* **Scalability:** Moving beyond free API quotas (429 errors) to "Pay-as-you-go" models to ensure service reliability.
* **Cost Analysis:** Identifying infrastructure costs including Cloud Servers (ECS), Storage (OBS), Text-to-Speech (TTS) services, and Domain management.
* **System Requirements:** Focused on managing **Latency**, **Concurrency** (handling multiple users), and ensuring **Data Privacy** (GDPR/KVKK compliance).

### 💡 Insight
A production-ready app isn't just about code; it's about cost-efficiency, redundancy, and low-latency user experience.
