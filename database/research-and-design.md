# 🗄️ Database Architecture Research

I initiated the research phase for the project's data persistence layer, focusing on building a scalable and efficient schema.

### 🔍 Research Areas
* **Schema Design:** Investigating relational vs. non-relational structures based on project requirements.
* **Normalization & Performance:** Researching normalization rules to ensure data integrity while maintaining high query performance.
* **Cloud Integration:** Exploring database-as-a-service options that integrate seamlessly with current cloud environments.

### 💡 Insight
The database is the foundation of any application. Investing time in research and architectural planning before implementation prevents technical debt and data inconsistency in the future.
