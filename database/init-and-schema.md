# 🗄️ Database Initialization & Schema Design

This week, we officially kicked off the database implementation phase for our interview platform project.

### 🚀 Key Technical Steps
* **Technology Selection:** Finalized the database engine based on the project's data consistency and scalability needs.
* **Schema Definition:** Started defining core entities (Users, Interviews, Results) and establishing relationships between them.
* **Initialization:** Set up the initial database environment and established the first successful connection with the backend services.

### 💡 Insight
Starting a database from scratch requires a "future-proof" mindset. Correct indexing and well-defined foreign key relationships at this stage prevent major performance bottlenecks as the data grows.
