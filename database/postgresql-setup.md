# 🐘 Database Environment Setup: PostgreSQL & DBeaver

Today, we initialized our database environment to handle persistent data storage for the project.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Database:** **PostgreSQL** was chosen for its reliability, ACID compliance, and advanced relational features.
* **Management Tool:** Integrated **DBeaver** as our universal database tool to manage schemas, execute queries, and visualize data relationships.
* **Collaboration:** Worked closely with my teammate to ensure local database environments are synchronized and ready for backend integration.

### 💡 Insight
Selecting the right tools early in the development cycle is crucial. Using a robust GUI like DBeaver alongside PostgreSQL enhances productivity and allows for better visualization of the data architecture.
