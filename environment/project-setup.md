# 🤖 Project Onboarding & Environment Setup

Successfully migrated and initialized a complex backend project in a new development environment (Antigravity).

### ⚙️ The Setup Process
* **Cloning & Dependencies:** Cloned the repository and managed dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* **The ".env" Strategy:** Understood that the `.env` file is the "heart" of the project and must be manually configured after cloning for security.
* **Directory Management:** Navigated backend structures and fixed path-related issues within the terminal to trigger "Application startup complete".

### 💡 Insight
The ability to clone, configure, and run a project from scratch is a fundamental skill for any developer joining a new team or server environment.
